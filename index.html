        Without it life as we know<br>wouldn't have existed. The story of it's origin is unkown for it is the elixir of life.
        It is the thing<br>which balances all life throughout this ball of rock we live upon, at the same time it is limited<br>
        and we shall not waste it. The purpose of water is not to be wasted but to be used wisely.</d></p></font>

        <p align="justify"><p2>Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's
        hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or
        organic nutrients. Water is one of the most plentiful and essential compounds, occurring as a liquid on Earth's surface under normal conditions
        , which makes it invaluable for human uses and as plant and animal habitat.Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, and it exists in gaseous, liquid,
        and solid states. Water is a tiny molecule. It consists of three atoms : two of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Water is the liquid that makes life on Earth
        possible. As water cycles from the air to the land to the sea and back again, water shapes our planet-and nearly every aspect of our lives. All living things,
        from tiny cyanobacteria  to giant blue whales , need water to survive. Without water, life as we know it would not exist. And life exists wherever there is water. 
        All organisms, like animals and plants, use water: salty or fresh, hot or cold, plenty of water or almost no water at all. They are adapted to all kinds of habitats,
        from sizzling deserts to the freezing, pitch-dark ocean floor. The first living things appeared in the ocean nearly four billion years ago. Some, like our ancestors,
        adapted to life on land. Humans have figured out how to survive in swamps, deserts, and all kinds of habitats in between. The ocean is still home to more kinds of life
        than anywhere else on the planet.</p2></p>

            <p align="justify"><p2>Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states.
                It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability
                to dissolve many other substances. Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have
                originated in the aqueous solutions of the world's oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions, such as blood and digestive juices,
                for biological processes. Water also exists on other planets and moons both within and beyond the solar system. In small quantities water appears
                colourless, but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths. Although the molecules of water
                are simple in structure (H2O), the physical and chemical properties of the compound are extraordinarily complicated, and they are not typical of most
                substances found on Earth. For example, although the sight of ice cubes floating in a glass of ice water is commonplace, such behaviour is unusual for
                chemical entities. For almost every other compound, the solid state is denser than the liquid state; thus, the solid would sink to the bottom of the
                liquid. The fact that ice floats on water is exceedingly important in the natural world, because the ice that forms on ponds and lakes in cold areas
                of the world acts as an insulating barrier that protects the aquatic life below. If ice were denser than liquid water, ice forming on a pond would sink,
                thereby exposing more water to the cold temperature. Thus, the pond would eventually freeze throughout, killing all the life-forms present.</p2></p>

            <p align="justify"><p2>Multiple geochemical studies have concluded that asteroids are most likely the primary source of Earth's water.
                Carbonaceous chondrites-which are a subclass of the oldest meteorites in the Solar Systemâ€“have isotopic levels most similar to ocean
                water. The CI and CM subclasses of carbonaceous chondrites specifically have hydrogen and nitrogen isotope levels that closely match
                Earth's seawater, which suggests water in these meteorites could be the source of Earth's oceans. Two 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites
                found on Earth that contained liquid water alongside a wide diversity of deuterium-poor organic compounds further support this. Earth's
                current deuterium to hydrogen ratio also matches ancient eucrite chondrites, which originate from the asteroid Vesta in the outer asteroid
                belt. CI, CM, and eucrite chondrites are believed to have the same water content and isotope ratios as ancient icy protoplanets from the
                outer asteroid belt that later delivered water to Earth. A further asteroid particle study supported the theory that a large source of earth's
                water has come from hydrogen atoms carried on particles in the solar wind which combine with oxygen on asteroids and then arrive on earth in
                space dust. Using atom probe tomography the study found hydroxide and water molecules on the surface of a single grain from particles retrieved
                from the asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Japanese space probe Hayabusa.</p2></p>
